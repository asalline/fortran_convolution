# 2D convolution implemented in Fortran 95

The convolution is mathematical background in image processing and image filters. 
It uses elementwise-multiplication and addition to change picture with given filter.

There is alot of articles and videos about convolution so I am not going to give any explanation here on how it works.

My convolution scripts are made with Fortran and Python.
Python scripts are to download images, transfer them into grayscale pixel-valued matrices and then read them back and show them.
Fortran is used to crunch the numbers.
